## Real Business Cycle Model

- [Python code for Romer ยง5.6](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JbJVdZcLY0_aNbDmJT_FruMm1tfzXlIZ?usp=sharing)   
  This Colab notebook presents Python code to run the simulation in ยง5.6 of Romer 5e. It basically translates Romer's verbal explanations of the method of undetermined coefficients into Python. For actual day-to-day research, you may prefer to use Benjamin Jenkins' **linearmodels** package or Dynare, but writing code yourself for once will be very helpful to absorb the algorithm.
